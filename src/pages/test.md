## Purpose and use of the Standards of Care

## 照护指南的目的和使用

The overall goal of the World Professional
Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH)
Standards of Care—Eighth Edition (SOC-8) is to
provide clinical guidance to health care professionals to assist transgender and gender diverse
(TGD) people in accessing safe and effective
pathways to achieving lasting personal comfort
with their gendered selves with the aim of optimizing their overall physical health, psychological
well-being, and self-fulfillment. This assistance
may include but is not limited to hormonal and
surgical treatments, voice and communication
therapy, primary care, hair removal, reproductive
and sexual health, and mental health care.
Healthcare systems should provide medically necessary gender-affirming health care for TGD
people: See Chapter 2—Global Applicability,
Statement 2.1.

世界跨性别健康专业协会（WPATH）《照护指南》第八版（SOC-8）的总体目标是为医务人员提供临床指导，以协助跨性别和多元性别群体获得安全有效的途径从而实现其对性别自我持久的个人满足，以尽可能改善其整体身心健康与自我实现。此类协助包括但不限于激素和手术治疗、嗓音和沟通治疗、初级保健、脱毛、生殖和性健康以及心理保健。医疗保健系统应为 TGD 群体提供医疗必要的性别肯定医疗保健：见第二章 全球适用性，声明 2.1。

WPATH is an international, multidisciplinary,
professional association whose mission is to promote evidence-based care, education, research,
public policy, and respect in transgender health.
Founded in 1979, the organization currently has
over 3,000 health care professionals, social scientists, and legal professionals, all of whom are
engaged in clinical practice, research, education
and advocacy that affects the lives of TGD people. WPATH envisions a world wherein people
of all gender identities and gender expressions
have access to evidence-based health care, social
services, justice, and equality.

WPATH 是一个国际性的、多学科的专业组织，其使命是推动跨性别健康方面的循证照护、教育、研究、公共政策和尊重。该组织成立于 1979 年，成员现包括 3,000 余名医务人员、社会科学家和法律专业人员，均从事影响 TGD 群体生活的临床实践、研究、教育和宣传工作。WPATH 的愿景是建立一个所有性别认同和性别表达的人都能获得循证医疗保健、社会服务、正义和平等的世界。

One of the main functions of WPATH is to
promote the highest standards of health care for
individuals through the Standards of Care (SOC)
for the health of TGD people. The SOC-8 is
based on the best available science and expert
professional consensus. The SOC was initially
developed in 1979, and the last version was published in 2012.

该组织的主要职能之一是通过针对 TGD 群体编写的《照护指南》（SOC）为该群体推动建立医疗保健之最高标准。SOC-8 基于跨性别健康领域现有最佳的科学知识和专家共识。SOC 最初制定于 1979 年，上一版本（SOC-7）于 2012 年发布。

Most of the research and experience in this
field comes from a North American and Western
European perspective; thus, adaptations of the
SOC-8 to other parts of the world are necessary.
Suggestions for approaches to cultural relativity
and cultural competence are included in this version of the SOC.

这一领域的研究和经验主要来源于北美和西欧的视角，若将 SOC-8 应用于世界其他地区，需进行相应的调整。本版本 SOC 内容包含文化相对性的方法和建立文化交流能力（cultural competence）的建议。

WPATH recognizes that health is not only
dependent upon high-quality clinical care but
also relies on social and political climates that
ensure social tolerance, equality, and the full
rights of citizenship. Health is promoted through
public policies and legal reforms that advance
tolerance and equity for gender diversity and that
eliminate prejudice, discrimination, and stigma.
WPATH is committed to advocacy for these policy and legal changes. Thus, health care professionals who provide care to TGD people are
called upon to advocate for improved access to
safe and licensed gender-affirming care while
respecting the autonomy of individuals.

WPATH 认识到，健康不仅取决于高质量的临床照护，更仰赖于保障公民完整权利、包容、平等的社会政治环境。只有透过公共政策和法律改革，增进对多元性别的包容、推动多元性别的平等权利，消除偏见、歧视和污名化，才能最终增进健康。也正因如此，WPATH 致力于倡导此类政策和法律变革，同时积极呼吁负责照护 TGD 群体的医务人员在尊重个人自主权的同时，推行更为安全、合规的性别肯定照护。

While this is primarily a document for health
care professionals, individuals, their families, and
social institutions may also use the SOC-8 to understand how it can assist with promoting optimal
health for members of this diverse population.

尽管 SOC-8 主要是为医务人员编写的，但个人、其家庭和社会机构也可以通过 SOC-8 来了解如何改善这一多元化群体的健康。

The SOC-8 has 18 chapters containing recommendations for health care professionals working
with TGD people. Each of the recommendations
is followed by explanatory text with relevant references. The recommendations for the initiation
of gender-affirming medical and/or surgical treatments (GAMSTs) for adults and adolescents are
contained in their respective chapters (see
Assessment for Adults and Adolescent chapters).
A summary of the recommendations and criteria
for GAMST can be found in Appendix D.

SOC-8 全文共 18 个章节，内容涵盖了对照护 TGD群体的医务人员的建议。每项建议后都附有说明和相关的参考文献。关于为成人和青少年开展性别肯定医疗的建议载于相应的章节（见成年群体的评估和青少年章节）。关于性别肯定医疗的建议和标准的摘要可参见附录 D。

## Populations included in the SOC-8

## SOC-8 所涵盖的人群

In this document, we use the phrase transgender and gender diverse (TGD) to be as broad and comprehensive as possible in describing members of the many varied communities that exist globally of people with gender identities or expressions that differ from the gender socially
attributed to the sex assigned to them at birth.
This includes people who have culturally specific
and/or language-specific experiences, identities or
expressions, which may or may not be based on
or encompassed by Western conceptualizations
of gender or the language used to describe it.

在此版本中，我们使用“跨性别和多元性别”（TGD）一词，以尽可能广泛而全面的方式描述那些在全球范围内多种多样的社群中性别认同或表达与其出生时被社会指派的性别不同的人群。
